CoinWhale is my capstone project at Strive School. What is CoinWhale? It is a Coin Market Cap clone with some social capabilities. With CoinWhale you can discover and learn something new about your favorite coins via the hottest tweets and youtube videos. 

CoinWhale signifies the end of my journey at Strive School. But more importantly, it also signifies the beginning of my journey as a frontend developer. I feel incredibly proud to have achieved this much in such a short period of time (~15 weeks). To my fellow batchmates, teaching assistants and teachers from Strive School - thank you for making me a better developer and more importantly, a better person.
